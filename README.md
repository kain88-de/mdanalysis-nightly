Summary: An object-oriented toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by CHARMM, Gromacs, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Amber.

MDAnalysis is a Python library to analyze trajectories from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. It can read and write most popular formats, and
provides a flexible and fast framework for writing custom analysis through
making the underlying data easily available as NumPy arrays.

Installing mdanalysis
=====================

Installing `mdanalysis` from the `kain88-de` channel can be achieved by adding `kain88-de` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels kain88-de conda-forge
```

Once the `kain88-de and conda-forge` channels has been enabled, `mdanalysis` can be installed with:

```
conda install mdanalysis
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `mdanalysis` available on your platform with:

```
conda search mdanalysis --channel kain88-de
```

Updating mdanalysis-nightly
=============================

If you would like to improve the mdanalysis recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/mdanalysis-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/building/meta-yaml.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
